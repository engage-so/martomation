      <span>Workflows and automations are interchangeably used across many tools. They mostly refer to the same thing.</span>
      <p>
        Automation is a sequence of processes that can be automatically triggered to perform specific customer-related tasks. For example, you can use automation to send customers a series
        of onboarding emails, update their attributes based on data changes, and send them happy SMS or appointment reminders.
      </p>

        (An automation can be used to create an email series. After all, an email series is just a sequence of processes. However, automations can do more than just send emails or other
        forms of messages. At Engage, you can use automation to add or remove customers from lists, update their attributes, call a webhook and do many other things).

            A Workflow is a sequence of tasks that processes a set of data. Workflows occur across every kind of business and industry. Anytime data is passed between humans and/or systems,
            a workflow is created. Workflows are the paths that describe how something goes from being undone to done, or raw to processed.

            Workflows are automated sequences that provide personalized messaging for leads and customers based on their behavior. Workflows are the pure definition of marketing automation
            and can be used to create everything from e-commerce abandoned cart sequences to SMS chatbots for lead nurturing.

            Automated email, also referred to as triggered email or behavior-driven email, is any message automatically sent from your email service provider (ESP) in direct response to an
            individual user’s specific actions made (or not made) on your website or web app.
          </p>
          <p>Automated email allows you to send real-time, one-to-one messages that strengthen customer engagement, retention, and loyalty.</p>
