        In customer messaging, Clickthrough rate (CTR) is a metric that measures how recipients click on links within a message content (most times an email). It is calculated by dividing
        the total number of recipients that clicked on links by total number of messages successfully delivered and multiplying by 100.

            A ratio showing how often people who see your ad or free product listing end up clicking it. Clickthrough rate (CTR) can be used to gauge how well your keywords and ads, and free
            listings, are performing. CTR is the number of clicks that your ad receives divided by the number of times your ad is shown: clicks ÷ impressions = CTR. For example, if you had 5
            clicks and 100 impressions, then your CTR would be 5%.

            An email click-through rate is the percentage of recipients who clicked on one or more links in your email. In pay-per-click marketing, a click-through rate is the number of
            clicks an ad received relative to impressions. Ideally, your email subscribers aren’t haphazardly clicking on links. No, you want them to take intentional action from your
            emails. That action of clicking on a link in your email and heading somewhere else is what contributes to your CTR. For email, the CTR formula is as follows:
          </p>
          <p>CTR = Number of People Who Clicked A Link / Number of Emails Delivered Successfully x 100</p>
