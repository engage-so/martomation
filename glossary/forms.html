        Products need to be able to get data input from users to function as necessary. This data could be for feedback, survey, list subscription, payment, or something else. Forms are how
        this is possible.

        A form is a page that lets you collect data from people in a structured way. In marketing, forms are mostly used for feedback, surveys, lead generation, and list subscriptions. When
        you create a list on Engage, an embed code for a form is also included to subscribe users to the list.

            A web form (or HTML form) is a place where users enter data or personal information thatâ€™s then sent to a server for processing. For example, users can provide their name and
            email address to sign up for a newsletter or place an order.
