            An email service provider (ESP) allows users to send email campaigns to a list of subscribers. Email service providers are technology companies that make it easier for people to
            build email lists and send emails. As email marketing has become a more popular marketing channel, more email service providers have sprung up to provide differentiated services.
            At the most basic level, an ESP needs to do two things: store email addresses and send emails.
