      <span>Email preheader text and email preview texts are interchangeably used in marketing. However, they are not exactly the same thing.</span>
      <p>
        An email preview text is a small line of text that appears below (or beside) the subject line in an email inbox to give the reader an idea of the email content. By default, the email
        client will use the first set of texts in the email content but you can use an email preheader text to customize what shows as the preview text. Most email marketing tools also
        provide a way to customize what is displayed as the preview text.
