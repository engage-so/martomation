            NPS email surveys are one of the most preferred ways to collect customer feedback. That is because NPS usually portrays the perception of a brand as a whole, rather than
            transactional satisfaction (where CSAT is most widely used).

            Net Promoter Score (NPS) email is sent to request customers to answer a short question and rate you on the scale of 0-10. It is one of the key metrics to measure the businessâ€™s
            success. NPS question measures the likelihood of somebody referring your organization to their friends or colleagues. It also helps to estimate future sales and hence the growth
            of the company.
