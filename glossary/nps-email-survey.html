            NPS email surveys are one of the most preferred ways to collect customer feedback. That is because NPS usually portrays the perception of a brand as a whole, rather than
            transactional satisfaction (where CSAT is most widely used).

            Net Promoter Score (NPS) email is sent to request customers to answer a short question and rate you on the scale of 0-10. It is one of the key metrics to measure the business’s
            success. NPS question measures the likelihood of somebody referring your organization to their friends or colleagues. It also helps to estimate future sales and hence the growth
            of the company.
