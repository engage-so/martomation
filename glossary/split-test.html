        A/B testing in email marketing refers to an experimentation process where two or more versions of an email with different subject lines, copy, and call-to-action are sent to
        subscribers or customers in different segments or groups to determine which email version will better convert.

            A/B testing, also known as split testing, refers to a randomized experimentation process wherein two or more versions of a variable (web page, page element, etc.) are shown to
            different segments of website visitors at the same time to determine which version leaves the maximum impact and drive business metrics.

            A/B testing (also known as [split testing](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/split-testing/) or [bucket
            testing](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/bucket-testing/)) is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one
            performs better. A/B testing is essentially an experiment where two or more variants of a page are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which
            variation performs better for a given conversion goal.
