            A call to action in a sales email is a short, simple phrase that usually appears at the end of your message. It should ask the other person to do something that moves the deal
            forward. It could be to book a meeting or to subscribe to get regular updates. Whatâ€™s important is that they do something to remain engaged.

            A call to action in online marketing is a button or hyperlink line of text that sends a user to a website of the brand's choice. A CTA's purpose is to compel customers to act.
            The CTA button is generally noticeable, appealing, and difficult to overlook. When companies employ CTAs, they are persuading consumers to do more than reading.
