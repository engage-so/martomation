            A thank you page is the page your visitors, leads, and customers see right after filling out and submitting a form on a landing page/web page. Think of it as the last step in your conversion process.

            Your customers and leads see your Thank You Page immediately after completing a form or making a purchase on your web page. It acts similarly to a confirmation email — except viewers don't have to choose to open it. Think of a Thank You page as both the last step in your conversion process and the first step for customer retention. The Thank You Page presents a prime opportunity to turn a lead into a customer — or a customer into a brand advocate.

            To explain it briefly, a thank you page is a web page on your site that visitors are redirected to after they successfully submit their information in your opt-in form. These pages hold the power to bring you countless conversion opportunities and even increase your revenue if done right.
