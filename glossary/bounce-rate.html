            Email Bounce Rate is the percentage of emails that have not successfully reached recipients. An email bounce occurs when a sender receives a Non-Delivery Report (NDR) for an
            email. The number of email bounces divided by the total number of emails sent gives the Email Bounce Rate.

            Bounce rates measure the percentage of how often your emails get “bounced” back to you. In other words, the email cannot reach the intended recipient and, therefore, must be
            returned to the sender with a notification of its bounced status.
          </p>
          <p>If this sounds familiar, it’s because it’s the same way that physical mail works. If there’s something wrong with the address, it gets redirected to the return address.</p>

          <p>A bounce is an email that is returned to the sender because it cannot be delivered for some reason. Bounces fall into two categories: hard bounces and soft bounces.</p>
          <p>
            Hard bounces are permanent. They can happen when the email address doesn’t exist, the inbox was deleted, or when the user blocked you as a sender. We remove those addresses from
            your list automatically.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soft bounces are temporary. They happen when your recipient’s mailbox is full or temporarily unavailable. We allow up to four soft bounces over 32 days for a given email
            address before removing it from your contact list.

            In internet marketing/business terminology, bounce rate is associated with the analysis of traffic to a company’s webpage. The rate (always a percentage) indicates the percentage
            of visitors that come to the site and leave versus those who come and view multiple pages.
