            Just like a series of emails that are sent out to a group of contacts based on pre-set time intervals, trigger-based automation or both, you can set your text (SMS) sequence into
            motion.
          </p>
          <p>Time-based text sequences involve messages sent out at predetermined intervals.</p>

            Automated text messages are pre-written SMS messages that are automatically sent to customers based on certain criteria. Such automation criteria can involve a schedule (sent 2
            hours before the start of a big sale), a timeline (sent one month after a customer’s last purchase), or a trigger (sent immediately after a customer completes a purchase).
          </p>
          <p>
            Through automatic text messages, businesses can reach customers with more personalized messages without the additional resources involved in sending out SMS manually. In this
            way, text message automations enable businesses to develop better connections with their audiences in a quick, cost-effective way.
