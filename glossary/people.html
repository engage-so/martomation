        >Marketing tools have different ways of referring to the individuals or businesses you have added to the tool for interaction. The most common terms are People, Audience, Users,
        Contacts, and Customers. They generally refer to the same thing but the choice of the term will depend on the exact function of the marketing tool. Most email marketing tools, for
        example, use “Contacts”. Marketing analytics tools mostly use “Users”.

            Customer is an individual or business that purchases another company's goods or services. Customers are important because they drive revenues; without them, businesses cannot
            continue to exist.

            Customers are the individuals or organisations who, in some way, actively engage with your business or brand. In the classic sense, this would be a commercial engagement where
            there is an exchange of monetary value in relation to the delivery of your product or service.
