            Transactional email is a type of automated email between a sender and a recipient. It differs from marketing email in that transactional email is triggered by events,
            interactions, or preferences within a service or application rather than by a company’s marketing campaign. For this reason, transactional email is sometimes called “triggered”
            email.

            Transactional emails are messages that businesses need to send in order to facilitate a transaction or provide a product or service, as requested by the customer. For this
            reason, companies don’t need to obtain consent from the customer to send transactional emails.
