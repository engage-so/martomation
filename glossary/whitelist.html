            A whitelist is a list of entities approved for authorized access or privileged membership to enter a specific area in the computing world. These entities could include electronic
            groups or organizations, privileged websites, or even email addresses. The whitelist may also refer to an actionable promotion or recognition of an organization, group, or
            individual. This term may also be known as an approved list.

            A whitelist is a list of administrator-approved entities including IP addresses, email addresses, and applications. Items on a whitelist are granted access to the system allowing
            them to be installed, altered, and communicated with over the privateâ€™s network. The goal of having a whitelist is to protect a private network and its devices from outside
            attacks.

            A whitelist (allowlist) is a cybersecurity strategy that approves a list of email addresses, IP addresses, domain names, or applications while denying all others. IT
            administrators use a whitelist as a quick and easy way to help safeguard computers and networks from potentially harmful threats or inappropriate material on local networks or
            across the internet.
