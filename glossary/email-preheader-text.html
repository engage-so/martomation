      <span>Email preheader text and email preview texts are interchangeably used in marketing. However, they are not exactly the same thing.</span>
      <p>
        An email preheader text is a summary text at the top of your email content, added to show as a preview text in your recipient’s email inbox. By default, the email client will use the
        first set of texts in the email as the preview text. Sometimes, this set of texts may not make a good summary. Setting a preheader text within the content lets you customize what to
        show as the preview text.
      </p>
      <p>Most times, the preheader text is hidden within the email content.</p>

            Email preheader is the summary text that follows a subject line when the email is viewed in an inbox. In many cases, it’s used to provide a short summary of the email, and is
            typically one sentence long.

            In brief, a preheader is a text that comes after the subject line when an email is viewed in your inbox. It’s often used to give your email list a taste of what’s inside the body
            of your email.
